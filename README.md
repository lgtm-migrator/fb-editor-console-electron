## Location of files

Form Builder Console creates a `formbuilder` directory in the userâ€™s documents directory.

Within the `formbuilder` directory, it creates a `forms` directory.

On Mac OS X, the forms are located at `/Users/$USER/Documents/formbuilder/forms`

### Committing changes

The Console app does not currently provide a way to automatically commit and/or push your changes - you must use your own Git client.


## Building and publishing forms
